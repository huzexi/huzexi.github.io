I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Sydney, supervised by [Prof. Vera Yuk Ying Chung](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/vera-chung.html). My research interests lie in visual tracking and image super-resolution. I am passionate about building AI systems with the latest computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to solve real-world problems.

I am also an AI software engineer at [Unleash live](https://unleashlive.com/), a pioneering Australian AI startup, where I build AI-powered systems for various exciting industries, including mining, renewable energy, traffic management, and more.
